For both a quick start as well as a detailed summary of creating and running
a CESM model case, see the CESM1.1 User's Guide at

             IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT CESM1.1.1 SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION

CESM1.1.1 has the flexibility to configure cases with many different combinations
of component models, grids, and models settings. However, currently it has only
been validated scientifically for the following configurations:
    
        0.9x1.25_gx1v6    B_1850_CAM5_CN
        1.9x2.5_gx1v6     B_1850_CAM5_CN

We are in the process of scientifically validating more resolutions and component sets,
primarily targeted to CAM5 component sets.  We will notify the community of updated
scientific support as this happens. To find out which additional grids and component
sets have been validated, please routinely check the documentation at
http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm1.1/
